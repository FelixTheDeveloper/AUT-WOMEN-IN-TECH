									<h2>About us | Our Events, Meetups and Groups</h2>
									<h3>Check out these groups and network with other women in technology.</h3>

									<h4>AUT STEM Women</h4>
									<p>
										AUT STEM Women is a Facebook group run by students which aims to encourage and support 
										women studying in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) courses by 
										helping them develop networking skills and succeed in their field of study. They focus 
										on bringing together driven women from different backgrounds and positions to form a 
										tight community within the university and also get connected with women working in the 
										industry.

										Facebook </a>
									</p>

									<h4>Programming Challenge for Girls (PC4G)</h4>
									<p>
										PC4G is an annual one day event to introduce junior high school girls to computer 
										programming, no experience necessary. The event originated at AUT in 2008, and since 
										then has become international, with sites all around New Zealand and the world.

									<h4>Refactor</h4>
									<p>
										Refactor wants to keep improving the New Zealand tech industry by inspiring women to 
										not only stay in it but get to the top â€” running teams, in board positions, on the 
										speaker line-ups at conferences, and as visible leaders to inspire an incoming 
										generation of smart women.

										entrepreneurial skills, connect with like-minded youth, and aid and enable their 
										communities.
