														Computer game content is usually created by a designer, but does this 
														always have to be the case? That is the interesting topic Sana Alyaseri 
														is exploring for her Doctor of Philosophy, which focuses on game content 
														development.
														“We’re working on studying and investigating the use of algorithms 
														inspired by nature to be hired in the procedural content generation of 
														games to get good quality game content.
														“I’m interested in the enjoyment of the gamer, and for my PhD I’m 
														investigating how to make this procedure a good experience for the 
														gamer, focusing on the quality of the game content.”

											</header>
												<p>
													If you like logic and creativity architectural engineering is a great 
													choice, says fourth-year student Durgeshni Chandra.
													“I’ve always had a keen interest in all types of engineering. Civil 
													engineering particularly caught my attention, but I was more interested 
													in the design aspects of civil engineering than the construction aspects. 
													When AUT introduced architectural engineering that was the perfect choice 
													for me.
													“I also believe that it’s very important to be mindful of environmental, 
													economic and social factors when it comes to buildings. Buildings that are 
													more sustainable and that consider these factors will be the buildings of 
													the future. By studying architectural engineering, I feel that I’m doing 
													my part to make this happen.”

												<h2>Pushti Shah</h2>
											</header>
												<p>
													She has always been passionate about technology and how it changes society, 
													says Pushti Shah who is studying business and computing at AUT.
													“I want to understand how the changes in technology impact the way business 
													is conducted. By studying business and computing I’ll be able to play my 
													part in driving the change to build a better working world.
													“What I love most about my studies are all of the practical tasks – we’ve 
													created a ticket booking application system, a human resource management 
													database, an interactive website and even a sales pitch video. Through all 
													of these assignments I can directly apply the theoretical aspects of my 
													learning and understand how I can leverage them in the real world.”
